        HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language. Basically, it's the "code"
        behind every webpage - even this one. if you're just beginning to learn
        HTML, let us tell you that it's fairly easy task. HTML without styling,
        can't do anything more than setting a layout, drawing a table, or
        creating frames - but it is handy you structure the content correctly ,
        which is important when you sit down to add style to your HTML.

        Tags are what you'll see the most when you look at any HTML source code. A tag can ideally be seen as a wrapper to any item on your HTML document. Tags tell what magic is to be done on the content enclosed by them.

        <ol>
          <li> <tag-example-1>I need a closign tag<tag-example-1> </li>
          <li> <tag-example-2/>I don't need a cloding tag.</li>
